In my late teens and first two years of my twenties I had quite the identity crisis. I did not know what I wanted from life and had no idea what I wanted to do. I have always seen higher education as something mandatory instead of a possibility to learn anything I want and become an expert in that specific field. 2022 was the year I realised which direction I wanted to go, this was an eye-opener and made life feel more meaningful. Because I now have a direction, a goal which I can work towards and I want to do everything in my power to reach that goal.
My name is Joost Dolstra. I work as a data analyst at WUA, an Amsterdam-based market research company. And, I am studying International Business at the University of Applied Sciences Windesheim.
My hard skills are:
•	Data Analytics
•	Programming in Python and SQL
•	Front-end Development with JavaScript, HTML & CSS.
My goal is to become a full-stack developer & data scientist. While there is an overlap between the two roles, for example, both use programming, I think the combination of the two positions; combining web development and programming skills with data analytics, mathematics, and machine learning & artificial intelligence is the ultimate way to provide value in the 21st century.
People around me describe me as someone who is eager to learn and intrinsically motivated. I have a made self-learning path for myself in which I work towards my goal. This path contains the skills I want to learn and the courses I need to follow in order to learn them. For this path, I made a curriculum which will lead me towards my end goal. I usually spend around 10 hours per week working on this path. I think learning on your own through self-study is the best way to learn new skills because the educational system is not well-suited for learning most skills.
What are my 21st-century skills?
•	Critical thinking
•	Creativity
•	Communication
In philosophy, the theory closest to my heart is Epistemology, the study of knowledge. The internet is loaded with useful information and free courses which anyone could take. The internet made it possible to watch classes on 20th-century politics from Harvard professors or machine learning classes from Stanford professors. This creates the possibility for people to learn what they want to learn and broaden their perspective on almost any topic. The only difficulty is finding out what is useful and creating a curriculum because the sky is the limit for people who are willing to learn on their own. I would describe myself as open to learning anything and striving to become knowledgeable (which in itself is impossible, because when you know more you will only realise how little you know).
